# What is the purpose of having this repository?

## I am practicing designing PCBs, with Mr. Forest Lee Ereckson mentoring me.  
This repository allows me to keep updated versions of my files so that Mr. Lee can easily access them.  
And, to track versions of my work and review the changes I've committed after each review.
