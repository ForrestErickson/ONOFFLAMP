# What is the purpose of having this repository?

## I am practicing designing PCBs, with Mr. Forest Lee Erickson mentoring me.  
This repository allows me to keep updated versions of my files so that Mr. Lee can easily access them.  
And, to track versions of my work and review the changes I've committed after each review.


## Things I learned during this project:
* I learned how to use the kicad built in symbol libraries.   
* I learned how to use the KiCad built in footprint libraries.
* I learned how to use the Manage symbol libraries to add a global library.
* I learned how to use the Manage footprint libraries to add a global library.
* I learned how to run ERC

* I learned how to use the bulk editor to add specifc feilds for the symbols, a cost feild can be useful to make a budget for manufacturing.
  
## Other
