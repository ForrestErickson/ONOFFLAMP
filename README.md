# What is the purpose of having this repository?

## I am practicing designing PCBs, with Mr. Forrest Lee Erickson mentoring me.  
This repository allows me to keep updated versions of my files so that Mr. Lee can easily access them.   
And to track versions of my work and review the changes I've committed after each review.


## Things I learned during this project:
* I learned how to use the KICAD built-in symbol libraries.Â 
* I learned how to use the KiCad built-in footprint libraries.
* I learned how to use the Manage symbol libraries to add a global library.
* I learned how to use the Manage footprint libraries to add a global library.
* I learned how to run ERC.
* I learned how to align the schematic to the grid.
* I learned how to use the bulk editor to add specific fields for the symbols. A cost field can be useful to make a budget for manufacturing.
  
## Other
* I learned the word courage return, which means "Enter".
* I learned that special characters behave in the same way they behave in HTML.
* I learned to be aware of spaces and image wrapping.
* I learned how to paste an image in the markdown, and here's an image.
