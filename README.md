## Summary

HOMEWORK 2

This repository is the outcome of my practice in designing PCBs.  
Here, I document the various evolutionary stages of my project.
I am practicing schematic and PCB designing using KiCad.

On the left side is the schematic wiring of the ON OFF lamp circuit, while on the right side is the copper routing on the PCB of the ON OFF lamp circuit.  


## Details

* I learned how to use the KICAD built-in symbol libraries.Â 
* I learned how to use the KiCad built-in footprint libraries.
* I learned how to use the Manage symbol libraries to add a global library.
* I learned how to use the Manage footprint libraries to add a global library.
* I learned how to annotate the schematic.
* I learned how to run ERC.
* I learned how to align the schematic to the grid.
* I learned how to use the bulk editor to add specific fields for the symbols. A cost field can be useful to make a budget for manufacturing.
* I learned how to draw and write on different layers, and how to enable and disable different layers.
* I learned how to use a connecter, how to wire the connector in a circuit.

  
## Other
* I learned the word courage return, which means "Enter".
* I learned that special characters in the mark down read me file behave in the same way they behave in HTML.
* I learned to be aware of spaces and image wrapping in the mark down read me file.
* I learned how to paste an image in the markdown read me, and here's an image.

## Credits
I would like to express my gratitude to the developers and maintainers of several platforms. Firstly, GitHub, for its project management features, issues tracking, and project board, which have consistently proven useful during our usage. Additionally, I extend my thanks to KiCAD for providing the tools necessary for schematic capture and PCB design. I also appreciate the inventors and developers of the Arduino ecosystem, whose tools and hardware have had a profoundly positive impact on many individuals.

Furthermore, I am grateful for the Public Invention platform, which has facilitated communication and collaboration. Special recognition goes to my exceptional mentors, Mr. Forrest Lee Ereckson and Mr. Robert Reed. Their guidance has been invaluable in navigating these projects, fostering skill development, and providing ongoing support. Their mentorship has empowered me to apply my knowledge to projects that benefit public invention.
